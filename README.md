# Badger

I just needed a name quickly - a place to put shallow, basic webby things in a sort of playground to easily have an example of https, serving static files, websockets, clients, etc.

This shouldn't try to be a framework - vertx is a framework.

This is a vertical spike to publish a 'hello world' using vertx for an https REST service and websocket.

The use case is simply:

1) login via REST
2) establish a socket based on a secret from #1
